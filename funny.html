    <title>Cock and ball torture (CBT), occasionally known as penis torture, dick torture, or male genitorture/male
        genital torture, is a sexual activity involving the application of pain or constriction to the penis or
        testicles. This may involve directly painful activities, such as genital piercing, wax play, genital spanking,
        squeezing, ball-busting, genital flogging, urethral play, tickle torture, erotic electrostimulation, kneeing or
        kicking.[1] The recipient of such activities may receive direct physical pleasure via masochism, or emotional
        pleasure through erotic humiliation, or knowledge that the play is pleasing to a sadistic dominant. Many of
        these practices carry significant health risks.[2]</title>
